        In July 2024, I stumbled upon an unexpected friendship in the virtual world of PUBG Mobile. At first, I thought I was just logging in to pass some time, maybe improve my skills, and enjoy the thrill of the game. But that’s when I met Plengpin, a 20-year-old from Chiang Mai, Thailand, studying Human Resource Management. I’m from Puerto Princesa, Palawan, in the Philippines, and never would I have guessed that a friend request in a video game would turn into a meaningful connection that crossed borders, cultures, and backgrounds.
When I first encountered Plengpin, she was just another teammate. We played a few rounds together, our characters exchanging quick instructions and sharing victories and defeats. But as we kept getting matched in the same games, we started to talk more. Our conversations gradually went beyond the game – we discussed everything from our daily routines to our dreams and fears. The more we talked, the more I felt a sense of ease and connection with her. Soon, the game became less about scoring points and more about spending time with someone who understood me.
I still remember the night I decided to share my Facebook account details with her. I was nervous, unsure if she’d add me or if she even felt the same connection that I did. When she sent me a friend request, I was both relieved and excited. Our friendship took a new form, and suddenly we had a window into each other's lives outside the game. We were no longer just PUBG teammates; we were friends who shared a bond that extended beyond our screens. It felt strange but wonderful to have someone from another country care about the small details of my life, like what I was studying, how my day went, and what I wanted for the future.
Our conversations on Facebook became just as important as the ones in the game. She shared stories of her life in Thailand, her experiences in college, and her aspirations. As she talked about her HRM studies, I could see her passion for helping others and building connections – qualities that reflected in the way she treated me, too. Even though she had her own busy schedule, she always made time to check in, to talk about the little things that made each day special. I found myself looking forward to our chats every night, eager to hear from her and to share my own experiences.
For me, the highlight of our connection was the way we made each other feel seen and valued. I often asked her if she liked me, and her answers were always the same: a simple “yes.” It reassured me and made me feel like I mattered to her. When I asked if she loved me, she would respond thoughtfully, saying, “I don’t know.” She explained that she didn’t fully understand love and felt unsure about her feelings. I respected her honesty, even though I had started to develop deeper feelings. I appreciated her willingness to be open, even when she felt uncertain.
As our bond grew, I began to realize that I was no longer just her friend from PUBG. I had become someone who mattered to her, and she had become someone who mattered deeply to me. Her kindness, her humor, and her ability to make me feel understood were qualities that made her stand out. She was like a breath of fresh air in my life, someone who brought joy and comfort in a way that I hadn’t expected. It felt like I had known her for years, even though we had only been talking for a few months.
There were times when I felt like we were more than friends, and I often found myself daydreaming about what it would be like to meet her in person. I imagined us exploring each other’s countries, introducing each other to our families, and experiencing the things we had only talked about in texts and voice calls. But at the same time, I understood that there were limitations to our friendship. We were separated by distance, language barriers, and different life paths. I tried to keep my feelings in check, reminding myself that we were just friends and that I shouldn’t expect more.
However, as much as I tried to maintain a sense of distance, there was always a part of me that wished for something more. I wondered if she felt the same way, if she ever thought about us as more than just friends. But every time I asked, her answers remained consistent. She cared about me, but she wasn’t sure about love. It was both comforting and painful to hear those words. On one hand, I was grateful that she was honest; on the other, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sadness, knowing that my feelings might never be fully reciprocated.
Things took a turn when I decided to take a break from our conversations. I needed some time to focus on my studies and to figure out my own feelings. I felt lost, unsure of where I stood with her and what our friendship meant. I thought that taking a step back would give me the clarity I needed. But during that time away, I realized just how much I missed her. Not having her around felt like a part of me was missing, and I found myself thinking about her constantly. I realized that she had become an important part of my life, someone I didn’t want to lose.
When I reached out to her again, things were different. She seemed distant, and I could tell that my absence had affected her. She told me that she wasn’t sure about us anymore, that maybe we were just friends. Her words stung, but I couldn’t blame her. I had left her without fully considering how my actions might impact her, and now I was facing the consequences. It was a painful lesson, but one that taught me the importance of being mindful of others’ feelings, especially when they mean so much to you.
Even though our friendship didn’t turn out the way I had hoped, I am grateful for the time we shared. Plengpin taught me about the power of connection, about the beauty of forming bonds with people from different backgrounds, and about the importance of honesty and openness in relationships. She showed me that sometimes, the most meaningful friendships are the ones that come unexpectedly, the ones that surprise you and change you in ways you never anticipated.
Reflecting on our friendship, I realize that Plengpin will always hold a special place in my heart. She was my friend, my confidant, and my partner in late-night conversations. She was the one who made me feel seen, who understood me even when I didn’t understand myself. And even though we may have drifted apart, I know that the memories we created will stay with me forever.As I move forward, I carry the lessons I learned from our time together. I know now that friendships, like all relationships, require effort, understanding, and a willingness to be vulnerable. I know that it’s important to cherish the people who care about you and to be mindful of their feelings. And most importantly, I know that even if things don’t turn out the way you hoped, the experience itself is something to be grateful for.
In a way, Plengpin helped me grow. She made me realize that love and friendship are complex, that sometimes people enter your life for a reason, even if they don’t stay forever. She taught me to appreciate the present, to cherish the people who bring joy into my life, and to let go when it’s time. I may never fully understand what we were to each other, but I am thankful for every moment we shared. In July 2024, I stumbled upon an unexpected friendship in the virtual world of PUBG Mobile.

It became a journey of self-discovery, of learning to appreciate the beauty of connection, and of understanding the importance of letting go. I will always remember Plengpin as the friend who taught me these invaluable lessons, as the person who made me feel alive in ways I hadn’t felt before.

Things took a turn when I decided to take a break from our conversations. I needed some time to focus on my studies and to figure out my own feelings. I felt lost, unsure of where I stood with her and what our friendship meant. I thought that taking a step back would give me the clarity I needed. But during that time away, I realized just how much I missed her. Not having her around felt like a part of me was missing, and I found myself thinking about her constantly. I realized that she had become an important part of my life, someone I didn’t want to lose.
When I reached out to her again, things were different. She seemed distant, and I could tell that my absence had affected her. She told me that she wasn’t sure about us anymore, that maybe we were just friends. Her words stung, but I couldn’t blame her. I had left her without fully considering how my actions might impact her, and now I was facing the consequences. It was a painful lesson, but one that taught me the importance of being mindful of others’ feelings, especially when they mean so much to you.
Even though our friendship didn’t turn out the way I had hoped, I am grateful for the time we shared. Plengpin taught me about the power of connection, about the beauty of forming bonds with people from different backgrounds, and about the importance of honesty and openness in relationships. She showed me that sometimes, the most meaningful friendships are the ones that come unexpectedly, the ones that surprise you and change you in ways you never anticipated.
Reflecting on our friendship, I realize that Plengpin will always hold a special place in my heart. She was my friend, my confidant, and my partner in late-night conversations. She was the one who made me feel seen, who understood me even when I didn’t understand myself. And even though we may have drifted apart, I know that the memories we created will stay with me forever.As I move forward, I carry the lessons I learned from our time together. I know now that friendships, like all relationships, require effort, understanding, and a willingness to be vulnerable. I know that it’s important to cherish the people who care about you and to be mindful of their feelings. And most importantly, I know that even if things don’t turn out the way you hoped, the experience itself is something to be grateful for.
In a way, Plengpin helped me grow. She made me realize that love and friendship are complex, that sometimes people enter your life for a reason, even if they don’t stay forever. She taught me to appreciate the present, to cherish the people who bring joy into my life, and to let go when it’s time. I may never fully understand what we were to each other, but I am thankful for every moment we shared. In July 2024, I stumbled upon an unexpected friendship in the virtual world of PUBG Mobile. At first, I thought I was just logging in to pass some time, maybe improve my skills, and enjoy the thrill of the game. But that’s when I met Plengpin, a 20-year-old from Chiang Mai, Thailand, studying Human Resource Management. I’m from Puerto Princesa, Palawan, in the Philippines, and never would I have guessed that a friend request in a video game would turn into a meaningful connection that crossed borders, cultures, and backgrounds.
When I first encountered Plengpin, she was just another teammate. We played a few rounds together, our characters exchanging quick instructions and sharing victories and defeats. But as we kept getting matched in the same games, we started to talk more. Our conversations gradually went beyond the game – we discussed everything from our daily routines to our dreams and fears. The more we talked, the more I felt a sense of ease and connection with her. Soon, the game became less about scoring points and more about spending time with someone who understood me.
I still remember the night I decided to share my Facebook account details with her. I was nervous, unsure if she’d add me or if she even felt the same connection that I did. When she sent me a friend request, I was both relieved and excited. Our friendship took a new form, and suddenly we had a window into each other's lives outside the game. We were no longer just PUBG teammates; we were friends who shared a bond that extended beyond our screens. It felt strange but wonderful to have someone from another country care about the small details of my life, like what I was studying, how my day went, and what I wanted for the future.
Our conversations on Facebook became just as important as the ones in the game. She shared stories of her life in Thailand, her experiences in college, and her aspirations. As she talked about her HRM studies, I could see her passion for helping others and building connections – qualities that reflected in the way she treated me, too. Even though she had her own busy schedule, she always made time to check in, to talk about the little things that made each day special. I found myself looking forward to our chats every night, eager to hear from her and to share my own experiences.
For me, the highlight of our connection was the way we made each other feel seen and valued. I often asked her if she liked me, and her answers were always the same: a simple “yes.” It reassured me and made me feel like I mattered to her. When I asked if she loved me, she would respond thoughtfully, saying, “I don’t know.” She explained that she didn’t fully understand love and felt unsure about her feelings. I respected her honesty, even though I had started to develop deeper feelings. I appreciated her willingness to be open, even when she felt uncertain.
As our bond grew, I began to realize that I was no longer just her friend from PUBG. I had become someone who mattered to her, and she had become someone who mattered deeply to me. Her kindness, her humor, and her ability to make me feel understood were qualities that made her stand out. She was like a breath of fresh air in my life, someone who brought joy and comfort in a way that I hadn’t expected. It felt like I had known her for years, even though we had only been talking for a few months.
There were times when I felt like we were more than friends, and I often found myself daydreaming about what it would be like to meet her in person. I imagined us exploring each other’s countries, introducing each other to our families, and experiencing the things we had only talked about in texts and voice calls. But at the same time, I understood that there were limitations to our friendship. We were separated by distance, language barriers, and different life paths. I tried to keep my feelings in check, reminding myself that we were just friends and that I shouldn’t expect more.
However, as much as I tried to maintain a sense of distance, there was always a part of me that wished for something more. I wondered if she felt the same way, if she ever thought about us as more than just friends. But every time I asked, her answers remained consistent. She cared about me, but she wasn’t sure about love. It was both comforting and painful to hear those words. On one hand, I was grateful that she was honest; on the other, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sadness, knowing that my feelings might never be fully reciprocated.

Our friendship might have started in a video game, but it became so much more. It became a journey of self-discovery, of learning to appreciate the beauty of connection, and of understanding the importance of letting go. I will always remember Plengpin as the friend who taught me these invaluable lessons, as the person who made me feel alive in ways I hadn’t felt before.
